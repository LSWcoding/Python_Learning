GIL:Global interpreter Lock
A lock that allows only one thread at a time to excute in Python
 
Needed in CPython because memory management is not thread-safe

Avoid:
Use multiprocessing
Use a different,free threaded Python implementation (Jython,IronPython)
Use Python as a wrapper for third party libraries(C/C++)->numpy,scipy
